1. create  a github repo with the project name and clone it inside  a folder.(add experiments)..
2. add source folder and run them individually..(here we have created complete components involved
   while executing  any project)..
3. add data,models and reports(i have not done it😅) to gitignore file because they are huge files of data 
   sets which normally are in gbs,so theycannot be handled by git .we would track them with dvc in future
4. fdo git add,commit and push ..

5. setting up a dvc pipeline (without params)
   >create dvc.yaml file and add stages to it .(if you dont know about yaml files then have 
    a go through on google ,its simple only 10 minutes you will know all about it)..
   >dvc init and then do dvc repro to test the pipeline automation(check dvc dag)
   >now git add commit and push
